A Model-Based Approach to Torque Modulation in EVs Using CAN and Simulink

* Objective
To develop a simulation model that controls and modulates the motor torque in an EV based on input conditions such as driver demand, system feedback, and performance constraints. The system aims to:

1] Enhance energy efficiency

2] Ensure smooth driving dynamics

3] Support scalable and modular EV drivetrain design

 * Key Features
Simulink-based Control Architecture:
A closed-loop torque control system is modeled in Simulink, incorporating blocks for input acquisition, control logic, motor dynamics, and feedback.

CAN Communication Integration:
The system simulates a real-time CAN protocol interface, enabling communication between Electronic Control Units (ECUs) such as the pedal sensor module and the motor controller.

Driver Input Simulation:
Accelerator pedal input is modeled and translated into torque demand, processed through control algorithms to generate appropriate motor commands.

Torque Modulation Logic:
Includes dynamic control strategies (e.g., PID or custom logic) to adjust torque based on speed, load, and system state.

Simulation & Analysis:
Time-domain simulations are used to observe torque response, communication flow over CAN, and overall system performance under various driving conditions.
